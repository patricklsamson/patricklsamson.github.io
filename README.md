## About Me

Currently a student of Avion School and aspiring to become a Web Developer. With the skills and knowledge I nurtured even before joining Avion, such as HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JS, I want to be able to enter the field of Web Development while having opportunities for career growth and professional challenges.
